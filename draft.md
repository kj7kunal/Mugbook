===========

## Overview of Service
Pokemon Go Social
Chats while waiting for a pokemon, chat groups in raids
## Target User
Pokemon Go community
## USP
147 million monthly active Pokémon Go users worldwide in May 2018
Crossed 1 billion downloads in September 2018; 500 million of these downloads occurred within the first three months after the game was released
Pokémon Go dominates the location-based category of game, claiming an 84% market share in terms of downloads, and a 92% share in terms of revenue (as of December 2018)
60% of Pokémon Go users are aged 18-34 according to one measure; another finds 38% aged 19-34, with a further 32% aged 18 or younger. 43% of Pokémon Go users are female, so the user base is quite gender-equal.
Indeed, while it may not be getting the numbers nor the consequent headlines as in its early heyday, Niantic reported later in summer that they had seen a 35% increase in Pokémon Go usage, which was when Niantic introduced some social features into the game. I believe, a social media focussed around Pokémon Go would be able to reboot interest in the game that has made people walk 8.7 billion km collectively in 2016 – enough to get to the end of the Solar System. Even though release of other AR apps topple down the old AR games market shares, Pokémon Go always seems to reclaim the market share lost to other titles in the same category; testament to its longevity.
The Pokemon Go app uses Java for backend server logic. Database is Google Cloud Data store’s NoSQL.
